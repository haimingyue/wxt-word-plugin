An Indie is, in fact, someone whos heart lies with indie, rock, alternative, music like that. You are all thinking of [scenesters]. An Indie Kid is, by no mean shape or form, a scenester. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndie Boys tend to be skinny, shy, with messy hair and a fringe. The hair must not be confused with emo hair, which is styled using disturbing quantaties of gel, wax, mousse and hairspray. Indie boys just can't be arsed to brush. Skinny jeans are more typical of the [scene kid], Indie boys prefer fairly loose fitting denim. A plain t-shirt or shirt are very popular, along with ancient battered converse, in black or blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndie Girls normally have wavy hair that looks bedraggled, and dress not a million miles away from the boys, just with more feminine styles. Indie Girls generally don't really care about their appearence that much, but scrub up pretty darn well, as opposed to a [scene girl] who is the scum off the earth. Indie girls wear any sort of jeans, comfy and casual t-shirts and the same footwear as the boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important difference between Indie Kids and [scene kids] is that indie kids are actually capable of having nice conversations with the bands they meet, as opposed to the scenester ego-boosting and myspace photo posing. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndie kids are friendly, cheerful and actually suprisingly non-elitest; I, as an Indie Kid(ette, maybe, as a girl) have many a time got down to the funky sounds of Snoop Dogg. Indie Kids are my solace in a sea of scenester scum.   \\n> Indie Kids, I salute you!!!\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"indie music":["","","独立音乐（independent music）","","","","","0","0","","",""],"indiella":["","","[医] 白色足霉菌素","","","","","0","0","","",""],"indies":["'indiz","n a pop group not affiliated with a major record company\\nn an independent film company not associated with an established studio","n. 印度地方, 西印度群岛","","","","","6196","0","s:indies/0:indies/1:s","",""],"indifference":["in'difәrәns","n. unbiased impartial unconcern","n. 不重视, 无兴趣, 漠不关心\\n[法] 中立, 不偏袒, 不重视","","","","toefl","7765","8021","","",""],"indifference curve":["","","[经] 无差异曲线","","","","","0","0","","",""],"indifference level":["","","[经] 无差异水平","","","","","0","0","","",""],"indifference map":["","","[经] 无差异图","","","","","0","0","","",""],"indifferency":["","n.
