This term also applies to the increased drain on taxpayer funded programs by underpaid and uninsured Walmart employees.\\r\\nWalmart sets up stores in buildings they \"rent\" from their own shell companies. They pay \"rent\" to themselves, then deduct it from their taxes. This [money grubbing scum] scheme helped Walmart avoid $3.39 Billion in state taxes from 1999-2005.\\n\\nAlso taxpayers will pay $9.1 Billion over the next 5 years to cover Walmart employee health care costs. They have almost 800,000 workers without health care coverage. Many of Walmart's employees are forced to use Medicaid or just show up at an emergancy room. This kind of bullshit taxes us all by increasing the cost of healthcare for all of us!\\n> The Walmart tax hurts the whole economy and helps keep them rich while shifting the costs to the people. Their [Pro-China] attitude towards merchandise hurts American jobs and their heinous tax avoidance schemes also hurt America's bottom line! Here's the real cost of the WalMart Tax-- If WalMart paid all of the taxes they owed in 2005: 318,440 uninsured children would have health coverage; 21,963 elementary school students would have new classrooms; and 9,499 additional police officers could be patrolling our streets! \"SAVE MONEY--LIVE BETTER,\" obviously this doesn't really apply to the shoppers only to the Walmart corporation!\\n> See \"Friendly Landlord: Wal-mart Cuts Taxes by Paying Rent to Itself\" by Jesse Drucker (Wall street Journal 2-1-07) and \"America Pays, Wal-mart Saves: The Growing Cost of the Wal-mart Health care Crisis\" at wakeupwalmart.com\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walmartized":["","cd's usually rap or hip-hop that have been censored to remove profanity or other objectionable material\\n> Whenever I buy a cd I always make sure its got the parental warning label on it , I don't want anything thats been Walmartized\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walmer":["",""," [人名] 沃默; [地名] [南非共和国、英国] 沃尔默","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walmsley":["'wɔ:mzli","","沃姆斯利(姓氏)","","","","","39935","0","","",""],"walmstedtite":["'vɑ:lmste,tait","","铁菱镁矿","","","","","0","0","","",""],"waln":["",""," [人名] 沃恩","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walnut":["'wɒ:lnәt","n. nut of any of various walnut trees having a wrinkled two-lobed seed with a hard shell\\nn. hard dark-brown wood of any of various walnut trees; used especially for furniture and paneling\\nn. any of various trees of the genus Juglans","n. 胡桃\\n[机] 胡桃木","","1","","gk cet6 toefl","8979","7840","s:walnuts","",""],"walnut blight":["","","[网络] 核桃枯萎","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walnut creek":["","","核桃溪市（美国加州）","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walnut family":["ˈwɔ:lnət ˈfæmili",""," [医]胡桃科","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walnut oil":["ˈwɔ:lnət ɔil",""," 胡桃油（可用作油画颜料结合剂）","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walnut parting":["","","[机] 胡桃木离模粉","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walnut tree":["ˈwɔ:lnət tri:",""," 核桃树胡桃树","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walnuts":["'wɔ:lnʌts","n. nut of any of various walnut trees having a wrinkled two-lobed seed with a hard shell\\nn. hard dark-brown wood of any of various walnut trees; used especially for furniture and paneling\\nn. any of various trees of the genus Juglans","n. 胡桃（树）( walnut的复数形式 ); 胡桃木","","","","","0","0","0:walnut/1:s","",""],"walp":["","","abbr. write ahead log protocol 向前写记录协议","","","","","0","0","","",""],"walpole":["'wɔ:lpәul","n.

The term “wapanese” can be accurately though of as an analog to [word]wigger[/word].  A [word]whitey[/word] can be classified as a “Wapanese” if they are in possession of two or more of the following defining traits:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n1.  Has an unhealthy obsession with shallow, saccharine and intellectually insulting animation shows (also refered to as [word]anime[/word] by the [word]nerd[/word] elite) originally tailored for young Japanese children\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  Operates under the erroneous belief that every aspect of [word]American[/word] culture is vastly inferior to that of Japan’s – even though 99.9% of Wapanese have never had firsthand experience of any sort with their preferred culture (in other words, they’ve never set so much as one foot upon the island(s) of Japan)\\r\\n\\r\\n3.  Halfheartedly studies Japanese language and/or is a part-time practitioner of martial arts\\r\\n\\r\\n4.  Has a sword (samurai swords only, of course) collection\\r\\n\\r\\n5.  Is a Virgin\\r\\n6.  May be afflicted with a terminal case of [word]yellow fever[/word]; however, they constantly fail in their quest for Japanese pootytang\\r\\n\\r\\n7.  Extreme cases may traipse around whilst wearing a “costume” that makes them resemble their favorite [word]anime[/word] characters (this practice is reffered to as [word]cosplay[/word]; cross-dressing and raging homosexuality is not an uncommon component of cosplay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, Wapanese are generally though of as “failures” and rejects within their own culture.  Social scientists such as myself speculate that it was their failure to gain acceptance within their own culture than has lead many a white [word]geek[/word] to seek out Japan’s culture as a surrogate; however, they’d be shattered to know that the insular and somewhat [word]racist[/word] Japanese society would be even less accepting of them than the people of their true and native culture.\\n> Wapanese munch on imported [word]Pocky[/word] and wash it down with a bottle of Pocari Sweat.\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"wapato":["",""," [地名] [美国] 沃帕托","","","","","0","0","","",""],"waped":["","a.
