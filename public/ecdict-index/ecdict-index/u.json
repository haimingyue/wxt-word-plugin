He adheres to the age old ignorant opinion, that the internet is some fantasy land where assholes can pop a squat and shit in public all day long.\\n\\nIn actuality, Ultraforge, is an atypical bored, suburban, married chode, with tons of time and internet access.\\n\\nIn between Nascar, WWE and beating his wife -due to his impotent, wretched existence- Ultraforge takes out his aggression from the safety of his PC, like most Youtube assclowns. He lacks talent, humor, or the personality to garner attention so, he sadly resorts to insults a 6th grader would pass on.\\n\\nHe also tends to cry like a bitch when someone blocks him from their channel or, someone trolls him.\\n\\nHis most common enemies, are 13 year old girls, emos, furries and, people with an ounce, or more, of dignity. Only easy targets that, require little effort or courage to assault. In short, he's a titanic pussy. An impotent weakling taking cheat shots from his trailer.\\n\\nHe's far too much of a pussy to hit anyone with clout so he settles for light weight shit. Thus, he is a joke to trolls. He is however, strong enough to deny the obvious fact that he has no life.\\n\\nTypical of shock value losers, he fills his profile with \"shocking\" quotes and images, like giving the finger (oooh my delicate sensibilities!) and the old \"Yeah I love pissing people off!\" admittance.\\n\\nHe apparently belongs to a group of \"dedicated trolls\" Which, might actually be the saddest thing I've ever read.\\n\\nA member of the [FCTC], which is a little boys club for poser trolls who brag about trolling like children brag about Pokemon collecting. Ultraforge uses inane rants about such hot button topics as Juggalos, furries and Jonas Brothers fans. Even most trolls hate these losers.\\n\\nThey needed to hype themselves with a weak ass ED entry and were properly beaten into the ground for it.\\n\\nWhat this means is that a few of his equally bored, dead inside, Dale Earnhardt jr. KFC bucket collecting, frog sticking, toe losing, cousin fucking buddies, shout \"fag\" in unison at strangers on teh interwebz for hyucks.\\n\\nIf he weren't a grown man, this might be acceptable. However, this sad sack is actually married with a child on the way. He's even featured his wife as trophy and hid behind his own child to justify his pathetic obsession with stupid sub cultures.\\n\\nHe also tends to spam the same lame responses of \"internet superhero\" and the oft misused \"Strawman\" words he learned on ED.\\n\\nThe amazing thing is, many of his video's exhibit massive, blatant emo tendencies. Such as, waxing poetically about how emos don't deserve the right to live and, similar over the top prose about whatever sub-culture has his little panties in a twist this week.\\n\\nIf emos allow their emotions to override reason, than surely a grown man who produces dozens of videos to bitch and whine about them, is guilty of the same thing.\\n\\nBut what good troll isn't a raging hypocrite?\\n\\nHopefully, when his unfortunate spawn grows up, changes their name and moves out of the trailer, they can show the world that even though they were brought into the world by a hateful, little man-child, they can still amount to something. Even if, mommy and daddy were turned down for promotions at the dirt factory.\\n> Ultraforge is a prime example of the Internet Fuckwad Theory.\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultraforming":[",ʌltrә'fɔ:miŋ","","[机] 起力重组法","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultragaseous":["","","[医] 超气态的","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultragaseous state":["","","[医] 超气态","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahard":["","","超硬; 特硬","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultraharmonic":["","","超调和的","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultraharmonics":[",ʌltrәhɑ:'mɔniks","","超(高频)谐波, 高(次)谐波","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh":["'ʌltrәhai","","a. 超高的,特高的","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency":["","","n. 超高频\\n[电] 超高频","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency converter":["","","[电] 超高频转变器","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency generator":["","","[电] 超高频产生器","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency loop":["","","[电] 超高频回路","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency receiver":["","","[电] 超短波接收机","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency transceiver":["","","[电] 超短波收发机","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency translator":["","","[电] 超高频译码机","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh frequency transmitter":["","","[电] 超短波发射机","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene":["","","[化] 超高分子量聚乙烯","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh pressure":["","","超高压","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh pressure vessel":["","","[化] 超高压容器","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh vacuum seal":["","","[化] 超高真空密封","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh vacuum(hhv)":["","","[化] 超高真空","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh-strength steel":["","","[化] 超高强度钢","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahigh-strength steels":["","","[化] 超高强度钢","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultrahyperpyrexia":["","","超高热","","","","","0","0","","",""],"ultraism":["'ʌltrәizm","n.

Sometimes particles and participial adjectives formed with this\\n   prefix coincide in form with compounds of the negative prefix un- (see\\n   2d Un-); as in undone (from undo), meaning unfastened, ruined; and\\n   undone (from 2d un- and done) meaning not done, not finished.
