Like everyone else, it all falls under personal preference. Sex is really such a personal and intimate act that no one answer would fit for everyone, but here are a few particulars to consider ... \\r\\n\\r\\nBODIES. We sometimes forget that the entire body is an erogenous zone. Sensitive areas include the face, ears, neck, arms, chest, belly, back, butt, and thighs, back of knees, calves, feet and toes. The entire body can be used to excite a woman. Rubbing bodies together, feeling erect nipples or moist pubic area can excite with subtle motions. \\r\\n\\r\\nFINGERS. Fingers can be delightful to use on those women who enjoy penetration (not all women do). Some women appreciate long, thin fingers while others like the feel of short, strong fingers. No matter what the preference, all women appreciate clean, short, well-filed nails. \\r\\n\\r\\nHANDS. Running hands up and down a lover's body will often elicit electric responses of passion. From light caresses down the back to deep rubbing across the butt, caressing is an important aspect to sex. Caressing often turns to gentle pinching or tugging at nipples. Lightly running fingers in a tickling motion across the belly and sides will excite many women. Once excitement has built, slipping fingers into the vagina or rubbing against the clitoris will often bring a woman to orgasm. \\r\\n\\r\\nMOUTH. Kissing is a good place to begin and a very important part of sex. Kisses come in different styles depending on the person, the mood and the moment. Tiny, soft kisses tantalize and intrigue. Deep, open-mouth kisses with tongues entwined convey a depth of passion and longing. Kisses are appropriate for any part of the body, wherever one feels the urge to place them, lightly or with trailing tongues. Gently nibbling or sucking on nipples excites some women, and some women can reach orgasm just from breast arousal. It is important to note reactions to these stimulations as some women dislike having their breasts touched at all. Gently nibbling or sucking on a responsive clitoris is enjoyed by most women and most often results in orgasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nPELVIC AREA. Some women can reach orgasm by rubbing pelvic areas together or against a lover's leg. This can be done with one partner on top or two women side-to-side.\\r\\n\\r\\nANAL SEX. Anal sex can include anilingus (licking the anus) and/or penetration. Penetration can be done with a finger or fingers, dildo or butt plug. Some women love anal sex, others do not. Like everything else, it's all personal preference. \\r\\n\\r\\nDILDOS, VIBRATORS & BUTT PLUGS. (Or objects used to vaginal or anal penetration). Some women use dildos and/or butt plugs some do not. Some use them occasionally; some use them all the time. Dildos come in many different shapes, colors and sizes. Some are shaped as corncobs, fists, dolphins or fingers. Some have attachments to stimulate the clitoris during penetration and some have two ends to stimulate two women at one time. It's all personal preference. \\r\\n\\r\\nFISTING. Fisting is penetrating a woman's vagina with your entire hand. Fisting requires a lot of concentration and caution. I recommend Hand In The Bush: The Fine Art of Vaginal Fisting, by Deborah Addington, if you want to learn the proper how-to on fisting. \\r\\n\\r\\nMUTUAL MASTURBATION. Many women enjoy mutual masturbation. Lying while facing each other, simultaneously rubbing and touching each other's clitoris can be educational as well as enjoyable.\\n> The two chicks had hot lesbian sex all night using dildos, fingers, mouth, n toys\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"lesbianism":["'lezbiәnizəm","n. female homosexuality","[医] 女子同性恋爱的","","","","","26156","27230","","",""],"lesbians":["","n a female homosexual\\nn a resident of Lesbos","n. 女同性恋者；女同志（lesbian的复数形式）","","","","","0","0","0:lesbian/1:s","",""],"lesbo":["'lesbәj","","n. <口>=Lesbian","","","","","48564","0","s:lesbos","",""],"lesbos":["'lezbɔs","n. an island of eastern Greece in the eastern Aegean Sea; in antiquity it was famous for lyric poetry","n. 莱斯博斯岛（即希腊的米蒂利尼岛）","","","","","0","0","0:lesbo/1:s","",""],"lesbro":["","1.

(It is a nice [pipe dream] but human nature will forever stand in the way of that goal).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost libtards subscribe to the notion that \"people are basically good\", and build their foundation for activism and \"improving the human condition\" on that faulty premise. Because they deny the facts about human nature, their \"reasoning\" is diametrically opposite to common sense (blue states vs. red states).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reality that people have different initiative levels, are basically selfish, and often work for their own interests before helping others, puts a libtard's [panties in a wad]. So, when citizens will not voluntarily comply with various libtard prescriptions for \"the common good\", then laws must be passed, or force used, to MAKE them comply. (It is the gradual path to totalitarianism).\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, his/her naïve cries of: \"can't we all just get along?\" and \"there is nothing worth dying for\" are red flags for anyone with a clue.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetaphorically speaking, a libtard is a sheep who thinks that their grasp of diplomatic nuance or metaphysical sensitivity will prevent their flock from being devoured by the world's Islamic/Communist wolves. When America, the sheep dog, responds to wolf attacks, the libtard judges these defensive actions as offensive and wolfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince libtards are unable to recognize our enemies for what they are, they cannot be trusted to safeguard our future.\\r\\n\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a large nutshell, a libtard's goal in life includes one or more of the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n--the establishment of a Socialist \"utopia\" (a.k.a. a global [nanny state])\\r\\n--\"benevolent\" totalitarian control of the world's population through any means necessary\\r\\n--ever increasing government micromanagement of private enterprise (a.k.a. clueless meddling)\\r\\n--the adoption of laws, treaties and tax regulations that hinder America's competitiveness\\r\\n--the usurpation of the legislative process, at all levels, through judicial fiat\\r\\n--the filing of specious law suits in order to thwart the will of the people (e.g. Calif. Proposition. 187)\\r\\n--the promotion of the tyranny of the minority\\r\\n--the filing of specious law suits to shakedown corporations for cash (under the guise of \"social responsibility\")\\r\\n--the disproportionate taxation of citizens \"who have more money than they need\"\\r\\n--the redistribution of wealth from producers to non-producers (under the guise of \"fairness\")\\r\\n--the banning and confiscation of all privately owned guns (even though it has lead to genocide)\\r\\n--the abolition of all private property rights\\r\\n--the destruction of all national sovereignty (America first, of course)\\r\\n--the destruction of Capitalism\\r\\n--the establishment of one religion (with no personal accountability), OR the abolition of all religion\\r\\n--the appeasement of Islamic radicals and their American front groups like CAIR (see: [Religion of Pieces])\\r\\n--the regulation, or banning, of all opposition media (under the guise of \"fairness\")\\r\\n--the appeasement of Communist dictators and their American front groups\\r\\n--the further insertion of Socialist ideology and indoctrination into public school curricula\\r\\n--the purposeful \"dumbing down\" of the masses through inane public school curricula and pedagogy\\r\\n--mass thought control through \"speech codes\" and [political correctness]\\r\\n--the further promulgation of the homosexual/pedophile agenda\\r\\n--the teaching of HATE (superficially disguised as \"Women's Studies\", \"African Studies\", etc.)\\r\\n--the legalization of marijuana (\"far OUT, man\")\\r\\n--the establishment of world wide socialized medicine (under the guise of \"fairness\")\\r\\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of the American economy\\r\\n--the demonization of attempts to make English America’s national language\\r\\n--world peace (which genocidal dictators define as: \"the absence of conflict\"--dead men cannot resist your brutal oppression)\\r\\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of humanity\\r\\n--the promotion of abortion as birth control, eugenics, and teaching the theory of evolution as fact (even though the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics precludes it from the get-go)\\r\\n--the abolition of individual freedom\\r\\n--anarchy\\r\\n\\r\\nNot surprisingly, there is a thread of anti-Americanism that runs through these ideas. A libtard cannot stomach the idea that America, despite its faults, is the greatest country in the world. As such, he/she sees it as their duty to tarnish the country's current and past image using all available means including: cherry picking facts and using innuendo, half-truths, lies and fabrications (see: [Rathergate]).\\r\\n\\r\\nLibtards’ actions undermine America's educational system, economy, criminal justice system, military personnel, sovereignty, security, and freedoms. Meanwhile, they try to fabricate a moral equivalence with rogue nations like China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, Somalia and Sudan. (But don't question their patriotism).\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE TO ALL MALCONTENTS: If America is truly evil, please pick yourself a better country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the health care system in Cuba, Canada or Great Britain is superior to America's, then you are free to leave. If the crime rate in China, North Korea or the [Magic Kingdom] is so much lower, then you too are free to leave. Not enough hedonism for you? Then try Amsterdam, Bangkok or Tijuana.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf life in general is better in Sweden, The Netherlands or Switzerland then WHY are you still here??? You talk big, but you lack the courage of your convictions. So do humanity a favor--shut up and move away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise get a real job, and get a life, because you obviously have WAY too much time on your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause most libtards are pantheists (New Agers), agnostics, atheists, liberal Jews, liberal Catholics, or have otherwise turned their backs on Jehovah, they lack true spiritual fulfillment. In order to try and fill that void, and \"to make a difference\", they work for the causes listed above. A pretty complete listing can be found at discoverthenetworks.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nA libtard will participate in protests, rallies, marches, bike rides, etc. in a feckless attempt to change whatever supposedly needs changing (see: [muckadoo]). Their desire to revisit the \"glory\" days of the 60's is sometimes a driving force. Regardless, the end result is usually the same: nothing actually changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, since a libtard wants to be rated for his/her good intentions, versus actual results, they leave these activities with a feeling of success \"because they have raised awareness\" or \"let their voices be heard.\" Post-protest gatherings often feature excessive drinking, drug abuse, and impromptu fornication to celebrate the \"victory.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause conservatives take responsibility for themselves and their children, have real jobs, under gird the economy, and value their time, their counter protesting is often negligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not that they don't care about their causes; they just understand that 1968 tactics are useless. Likewise, their sense of self worth does not come from how well they perform at work, or in life, but from a realization that they have been given a good and satisfying destiny that no one can take away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all of this in mind, may we NOW question a libtard's patriotism???\\n> “You are listening to CNN, the Communist News Network.”\\n> Anchorman: “Good morning, I’m E. Feet Liberal. Our top story, disastrous former mayor of Cleveland, Dennis Cucinich, has been appointed to head the newly created Department of Rainbows, Unicorns and Dandelions. When told of his appointment, Cucinich remarked,\\n> ‘As former ambassador to the Crab Nebula, I am looking forward to bringing my diplomatic expertise to the problem of terrorist, er, civilly challenged attacks on our planet. I even stopped by a gift shop on Alpha Centauri and bought a new pair of rose colored glasses!’\\n> We now go to Chip Onner-Shoulder for a live report.”\\n> Womyn Reporter: “Thanks E. Secretary Cucinich wasted no time in convening a meeting with top terrorist, er, civilly challenged leaders and their fellow travelers from CAIR. Among the items on the agenda were: convert to Islam or DIE, the institution of Shari’a, the obliteration of Israel, and bringing them the head of Jerry Springer on a stick. Let’s listen in.”\\n> Cucinich: “There there Abdul, why don’t we all take a ten minute break and go to our ‘happy places’?”\\n> Terrorist, er, Civilly Challenged heathen: “You're a clueless libtard. Death to those who insult Islam!”\\n> Cucinich: “Now now Abdul, I know that the civilly challenged have legitimate grievances, but America has a Band-Aid big enough for any third world boo boo. Hey what’s that under your dirty nightshirt?”\\n> KA-BOOOOOOM!!!\\n> Womyn Reporter: “Oh my Gaia! That man just detonated an explosive vest. He must have been a Mossad agent. I’ll try and get a comment from CAIR’s spokeswhore. Excuse me sir, was this the work of Israeli intelligence?”\\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: “Of course it was you decadent whore! And how dare you show your ankle in public! Now kneel down and receive your beating.”\\n> Womyn Reporter: “But I thought Islam was the Religion of Peace!”\\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: “It IS. And if you call us violent, we’ll kill you!”\\n> Womyn Reporter: “Can we stand in a circle and sing Kumbayah?”\\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: (smacks forehead) “ALLAH no!”\\n> Womyn Reporter: “Can’t we all just get along?”\\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: “Yes, when you’re dead.”\\n> Womyn Reporter: (backing up) “Stay away from me you seventh century, scum-sucking pig dog, and put DOWN that scimitar! Hellllp!”\\n> Anchorman: “Chip! Chip are you still there? Well, we seem to be having some technical difficulties with Chip’s mic.\\n> In other news, the Sierra Club is lobbying Congress to develop wind-powered commuter jets.

It has been known throughout history to have been done, but as of June 27, 2008, no one had ever come up with a name for it, but the \"eating fanatics\" and \"anti-smoking\" liberal activist judges did make a word for eating human flesh, clearly showing the corrupt cannibal lobbyists in the United States Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\n== History ==\\r\\nThroughout history, many important leaders and historical figures have been known to have been lymtudors.  Some examples are [[Rene Descartes]], [[Johan Gutenberg]], and [[Hester Prynne]].  \\r\\n\\r\\n== Side Effects ==\\r\\nThe side effects include most notably the inexplicable urge to build model bridges.  This can be equated to a well known issue referred to as the \"munchies\" often experienced by partakers of marijuana.  Some lymtudors experience rare side effects such as the femurs turning into melted cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  Also some may go unconscious and wake up in Asia wearing a human lung as a hat or [[cephalapleuring]].\\r\\n\\r\\n==Narcitudors==\\r\\nNarcitudors are a sub-branch of lymtudors who are known to enjoy only smoking their own flesh.  Many [[witches]] are part of this subculture and would often commit crimes in order to force the townspeople to burn them at the stake.  Also, [[Joan of Arc]] was a well known lymtudor and built a pyre on which she could burn herself and inhale her burning flesh.  The [[Buddhist monks in Saigon]] were also very well known narcitudors as they decided to protest the United State's banning of lymtudor grade flesh in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n==Contributions to society==\\r\\nLymtudors are used in most new construction.  This is done when project managers create huge oversized bridges anywhere, and hope that lymtudors will construct the model sized bridges, which will be the size that was intended, in the correct location, so as to save on labor costs.  The quality of these bridges are very poor as they are only made of balsa wood and super glue and well over pi squared people have been injured in lymtudor constructed bridge collapses.\\n> I knew a man who smoked three shylocks, and constructed nineteen model bridges in an hour once.
