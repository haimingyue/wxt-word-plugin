Eazy E was born in Compton on September 7, 1963. A former drug pusher and 10th grade dropout Eazy puts his stuff together with Ice Cube and Dr Dre to make \"Boyz n the Hood'. Eric W. meets J Heller and together they form Ruthless Records.With a new label and Dre, Ice Cube, Dj YElla,Eazy E, and MC Ren, the West Coast gangsta rap group N.W.A releases Straight Outta Compton a controversial album of ghetto LA life. The group releases the single \"Fuck tha Police\" which leads to the FBI sending a warning letter to Ruthless. Eazy released 'Eazy duz it' his only complete solo album in 88. Ice Cubes leaves NWA which leads to Dr. Dre also leaving NWA. Eazy's career was in trouble now, with Dre gone no one could produce the beats. This lead to Ruthless spirlaing downward. In desperation Eazy signs Bone Thugs n Harmony, which becomes a huge group.Eazy releases tracks once in a while, but in mid March of 95 Eazy finds out he has AIDS and 10 days later he dies of AIDS related lung illness.

(Such as Bright Eyes.)  Emo girls like to hang out with other emo girls and emo boys.  They are usually sad most of the time, do not smile very often, and just like emo boys, show no signs of self worth or self confidence whatsoever and will not make eye contact with you. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn emo girl has very dark hair, either cut somewhere around their shoulder, or in the classic emo haircut, which is sort of short and spiky in the back with long sweeping bangs in the front.  Their hair has to be very dark brown or black, or in some cases very light blonde as long as the cut is right.  No matter what, it must be worn so that it is covering part of their face at all times.  This is because emo girls tend to be shy and mysterious and don’t really want their face to show too much.  They usually wear a lot of dark eyeliner and tend to have washed out skin. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost emo girls are vegetarians or vegans. Although some girls just dress in the emo style, most emo girls are sad; cry and write poetry a lot, and tend to cut their wrists.  They usually hide this by wearing armbands or lots of happy colored bracelets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir clothing consists of tight jeans, converse and dark colored tight shirts.  They also might have a scarf on.  They may a few have pins from shows on their jeans.  They usually have at least a few piercings and wear lots of happy colored jewelry.  Some wear horn rimmed glasses, some do not.   They really don’t like it if you confuse them with a goth. Emo and goth are very different so don’t make this mistake. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey are most likely to be seen at shows, looking completely sad and lost.  Emo girls also love it when emo boys make out with each other (which they tend to do a lot).      \\r\\n \\r\\nJust like Emo boys, they usually walk with their head down not making eye contact with anyone.  Although most Emo kids are very sad and feel like the world hates them, they tend to understand what other Emo kids are going through.\\n> That girl over there in the corner with the dark hair, listening to Bright Eyes, and staring at the floor must be emo.\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"emo kid":["","COOL EMO KID: doesnt care what ppl think, likes a good band whether they are on mtv or not, and won't stop listening to some band just cuz everyone suddenly 'discovered' them.  they do nothing to make ppl feel bad for them, and want no ones sympathy.  they give everything a chance before deeming it cool or uncool.  and if they want to kill themselves, they do it.  they dont shop regularly at hot topic, but dont' completely disregard it.  if there's something they want to buy, they go for it, and dont deny they bought it there.  most of what they wear is from hand me downs, a garbage, a thrift shop, or was found.  they dress how they want, and never deliberately try to piss ppl off or 'rebel'.  if they do something rebellious, it is not just to be rebellious, it is because they want to/believe in doing it.  they respect people who dont want to put drugs in their body, but some COOL EMO KIDS do drugs because they feel like it\\r\\n\\r\\nANNOYING EMO KID: those kids who regularly max out daddy's credit card at hot topic and tell everyone how depressed they are and that they cut their arms up every night wanting to die (ok...where are the scars?).  they only listen to 'underground' bands adn immediately stop when someone they think is popular or preppy starts to listen to them, or they see them on mtv (which they claim never to watch, but they still do).  they intentionally do stupid and rebellious things trying to make authority figures mad, thinking it's cool.  these people are attention-craving, tasteless, abnoxious emo kids. anything popular is completely disregarded to them.   they also tell ppl that they think drugs are sooooooooooo cool, but are scared to do them, but do them anyway because they think it'll make them cool\\n> COOL EMO KID: that guy wearing some vintage tight tee and dirtied up black chuck taylors who is genuinely sincere and tells everyone what he thinks (tho never rudely unless he is already pissed at them)\\n> ANNOYING EMO KID: the guy who draws on a bruise to make ppl think his dad hits him and who only talks to other ANNOYING EMO KIDS\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"emodin":["'emәdin","n.

At the time of this writing, two major issues face this scum sucking moolie. The first being the refusal to pursue black on white crime as 'hate' crime, even though it is obvious to everybody that this was the motive. The second is the 'Fast and Furious' scandal that ultimately helped cause the deaths of law enforcement personnel. The agenda here being the false argument in favor of banning semi-automatic firearms, claiming they are falling into the hands of criminals across the border. This of course they would hope would open the flood gates to still more forms of gun control in an attempt to disarm the American public.\\n> That shitstain Eric Holder - Attorney General is refusing to present documents relating to the Fast and Furious scandal to congress.
