Quaaludes (Methaqualone) are a group of CNS depressants classed as \"hypnotic sedatives\" with a similar effect to alcohol.  Effects are sedation, decrease in anxiety, loosening of inhibitions, and loss of balance. Some people experience pleasant body effects. Side effects include disorientation, extreme sedation/sleep, grogginess the next day, and memory loss. One should be careful not to combine quaaludes or benzodiazepines with alcohol or other CNS depressants (opiates, ghb, etc). They are synergistic drugs and can greatly amplify the effects and side effects of each drug, and cause extreme illnes and possibly death.

If you currently use the term \"quote unquote\" (and especially if you do the finger thing) please stop it now. Don't feel bad. It's an understandable mistake because the idiots on Fox News say it all the time as does your boss at work, most probably. But read on...\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all, it should be QUOTE and ENDQUOTE. These are the official names for the double apostrophe symbols (\") on your keyboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the proper syntax is to say QUOTE, followed by the phrase, closed by ENDQUOTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nCORRECT USAGE (spoken):\\r\\nWhat do you think of Bush's quote War on Terror endquote?\\r\\n\\r\\nmeans:\\r\\nWhat do you think of Bush's \"War on Terror?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nINCORRECT USAGE (spoken):\\r\\nWhat do you think of Bush's quote unquote War on Terror?\\r\\n\\r\\nmeans:\\r\\nWhat do you think of Bush's \"\"War on Terror?\\r\\n\\r\\nGet it? Good. But try to avoid saying it altogether. Using the phrase \"so-called\" is much more acceptable. Example:\\r\\nWhat do you think of Bush's so-called War on Terror?\\n> (Incorrect but common usage)\\n> BOSS: Ok people, let's get proactive. This is a win-win situation. So give it 110% and quote unquote kick some ass!\\n> EMPLOYEE: Man, you're such a putz.\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quoted":["","v repeat a passage from\\nv name the price of\\nv refer to for illustration or proof\\nv put quote marks around","v. 引证（quote的过去式）","","","","","14982","25195","0:quote/1:dp/d:quoted/p:quoted","",""],"quoted company":["","","[经] 上市公司","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quoted flat":["","","[经] 光价, 报价平稳, 开价无涨落","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quoted price":["","","[经] 收盘价格","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quoted securities":["","","[经] 挂牌证券","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quoted string":["","","[计] 引证字符串","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quoted string literal":["","","[计] 引证字符串文字","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quoter":["","n. a communicator (speaker or writer) who uses quotations","n. 引用者, 报价者","","","","","0","0","","",""],"quotes":["","n a punctuation mark used to attribute the enclosed text to someone else\\nn a passage or expression that is quoted or cited\\nv repeat a passage from\\nv name the price of\\nv refer to for illustration or proof\\nv put quote marks around","n. 引用, 引号；报价（quote的复数）","","","","","0","0","0:quote/1:3s","",""],"quotev":["","Formerly known as Quizazz.
