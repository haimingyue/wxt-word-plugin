Then, To prevent host death, It gives the host small amounts of oxygen from two sacs behind the legs of the Facehugger. Once the embryo is implanted, it sinks down into the upper chest of the host, where it gestates. As soon as the Embryo loses touch with the implantation 'tongue' of the facehugger, the facehugger detatches and dies. Then the Embryo grows into Phase three.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhase three - Chestburster, The Production of the embryo, it's name comes into play when it is fully grown.

Human and Yautja Borne-Xenomorph chestbursters are relatively small, but Dog and cat, and soforth borne Xenomorphs grow until they no longer fit in the host's stomach, then they 'burst'. The Chestbursters gnerally take familiar traits from the host Humans 'give birth' to Xenomorphs with Humanly capabilities, such as Bipedalism.

If it was born from a Marine, It would grow as a Warrior or a soldier, If it was born from something that was unemployed, or a working class person, It would be a Drone, a worker.

They have thinner bones, but stronger appendage muscles*** To help them run. But as it also seems, it helps them capture prey if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoldiers#6: Extremely powerful muscles, and thicker bones, to make them powerful to destroy, But it also slows and weighs them down. They are not protectors by any means, They are sent to make war against deadlier threats. Usually they aren't even birthed, because the Xenomorph's usually assimilate everything, instead of destroy it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarriors#2: The bridge between drones and Soldiers, They protect and fight for the queen. They have thicker bones and stronger muscles, but not as thick or strong as the Soldier, to balance them out.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrætorians - seven are born, and protect the queen, nothing else. They are born after the queen, but live much longer, to protect the queens final-laid egg, her successor. They die out after the Praetorian eggs are born. They are bigger, stronger, somewhat undersized queens. They have powerful, small arms proof, skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueens#2/4/5 - The Largest Xenomorph, one of it's kind is birthed to a hive from the previous one. This is the complete Schbang, she gives birth to the eggs, and orders all of the Xenomorphs born, ALL OF THEM. She is secreted to an Egg chamber, where the Eggs come out from. However, if the situation calls for it, she can detatch from the egg laying device. Since she is noramlly secreted to the wall, she has little balance, and stutter-steps around when free.\\r\\n\\r\\n*-Queens and Prætorians have their own Special Facehuggers\\r\\n**-Born before a queen, casting them out of a hive.\\r\\n***-Born from a lower creature, like a cat, or a dog, or an Ox.\\r\\n#-Which movie the Xenomorph class was encountered\\r\\n1-Alien (1979)\\r\\n2-Aliens (1986)\\r\\n3-Alien3 (1992)\\r\\n4-Alien Resurrection (1998)\\r\\n5-Alien Versus Predator (2004)\\r\\n6-Alien Versus Predator: Requiem (2007)\\n> \"Come on!
