The sword closely resembles the nodachi or odachi, however it differs from the nodachi by having a ricasso of approximately 12 to 18 inches (460 mm). This lends more to the theory of the sword having a practical use in feudal Japan. The increased length of the blade, along with the extra grip, would give it dual use both as a sword and as a polearm for attacking advancing cavalry. This style of zanbato sword can be found for sale in rural tourist shops and stands in Kyoto and Nara prefectures of Japan. This sword may have been inspired by the Chinese zhan ma dao as both were said to have been used for killing the horse and rider in one swing. It is likely that the zanbato is actually a mis-construction of the zhǎn mǎ dāo, poorly drawn or translated by Japanese travellers who witnessed the weapon being used during battle.\\n> Such extremely long and curved zabatao swords did exist, and were solely used for ceremonial purposes. Experienced smiths often took upon themselves to prove their talent by creating these so-called \"zanbato\" as a way to challenge themselves. This led to the extremely long blades often seen in ancient depictions, some of which were so long (over a dozen feet long) that they could hardly be mistaken for something other than display pieces.\\n","","","","","","0","0","","",""],"zancanaro":["",""," [人名] 赞卡纳罗","","","","","0","0","","",""],"zanclidae":["","","镰刀鱼科","","","","","0","0","","",""],"zand":["",""," [人名] 赞德; [地名] [荷兰、伊朗] 赞德","","","","","0","0","","",""],"zande":["",""," [地名] [比利时] 赞德","","","","","32343","0","","",""],"zander":["'zændә","n.

These women dared to depart from the traditional coalitions for Black women and sought to establish a new organization predicated on the precepts of Scholarship, Service, Sisterhood and Finer Womanhood. The trail blazed by the founders has been traversed by thousands of women dedicated to the emulation of the objectives and ideals of the Sorority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sorority was the, first Greek-letter organization to charter a chapter in Africa (1948); to form adult and youth auxiliary groups, the Amicae, Archonettes, Amicettes, and Pearlettes; and to be constitutionally bound to a brother group, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incorporated.\\r\\n\\r\\nZeta's national and local programs include endowment of its National Educational Foundation; community outreach services; and support of multiple affiliate organizations. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. was founded on the campus of Howard University on January 16, 1920 by five illustrious women. These five women, our five pearls, were trailblazers; transcending the bounds of finer womanhood. Arizona Cleaver Stemmons, Myrtle Tyler Faithful, Pearl Anna Neal, Fannie Pettie Watts and Viola Tyler Goings were the foundation of a sisterhood that now spans the globe encompassing more than 100,000 members. Assisting our founders in establishing a well rounded, self sustaining, and innovative organization were two Brothers of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.: A. Langston Taylor and Charles Robert Taylor. \\r\\n\\r\\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. was founded on the ideals of scholarship, sisterly love, community service and finer womanhood. With these ideals under our wings, Zeta has set a tradition of \"firsts\". Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. was the first Greek letter organization to charter a chapter in Africa, form auxiliary groups, and establish a national headquarters. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. is the first and only Black Greek letter organization to be constitutionally bound to a fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs an international service organization, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. has over 100,000 members in more than 50 chapters including: West Africa, West Germany, Bahamas Islands, Virgin Islands, South Korea, and Italy.

For this he was forced into an Agni Kai with his father, who gave him a huge scar on the left side of his face as a reminder of his \"shame\". He was then banished with his wise uncle Iroh and would not be allowed home until he caught the Avatar, and thus return his honour.  \\r\\nIn season 2 Zuko and Iroh become fugitives. Whilst Iroh just wants to start a new peaceful life, Zuko still yoyos between good and bad. A new persona is borne of this inner conflict - the Blue Spirit.\\r\\nWhen it finally seems Zuko has changed for the better he throws it all away to return to the Fire Nation with his evil sister Azula and claim his throne once again. \\r\\nSeason 3 sees Zuko still struggling between good and evil. Although he now has his throne back, he feels guilt and anger because it was through his fault that his uncle was thrown in prison. He eventually confronts his evil father and says that he is leaving to help the Avatar learn firebending. Ozai shoots lightening at his son, but through a lesson Iroh had taught him Zuko was able to redirect it. He escapes and follows Team Avatar to the Western Air Temple, where he offers to help teach Aang. Despite being ultimately rejected and attacked after his first attempt, the team eventually allows him to join, mostly thanks to Toph's support of him. However Katara doesn't trust him at all and at the end of \"The Western Air Temple\" gives Zuko a serious warning not to step out of line, or she will make sure his destiny ends permanently.\\n> \"Hello, Zuko here.
